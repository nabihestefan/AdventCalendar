# Advent of Code

This is the repo where I will keep my yearly code made for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private/view/999114)  
Started in 2021 but decided to go back and solve previous years.  
There are folders for each language that I have attempted to solve in, I began in Python in 2021 and went back and got the 350 stars (at the time, now more), and then decided to do other languages in 2015 to learn them, since it was a pretty easy year.
