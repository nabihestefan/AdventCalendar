# Advent of Code

This is the repo where I will keep my yearly code made for ![Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private/view/999114)
Started in 2021 but decided to go back and solve previous years
All done in Python but challenging myself to use as little libraries as possible (not saying no libraries because I dont hate myself that much)
