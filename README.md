# Advent of Code

This is the repo where I will keep my yearly code made for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private/view/999114)  
Started in 2021 but decided to go back and solve previous years.  
For Python, I attempted to solve as many of them as I could without using any libraries, I ended up giving up for some in using `copy`, `networkx`, and `z3`, but for the most part no libraries. 
Any other languages I used were used to learn while doing problems I knew I understood.
