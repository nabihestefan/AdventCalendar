# Advent of Code

This is the repo where I will keep my yearly code made for ![Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private/view/999114)
Started in 2021 but decided to go back and solve previous years
Done in Python since it's the language I know the best.
I decided to challenge myself to use as little libraries as possible, theres some problems where I had to/it was crazy not to use libraries but in general I didnt use any
Momstly the libraries used were: copy for some deepcopies, networkx when there was graph things, and some collections and heapq for problems that took hours to run when no using them
