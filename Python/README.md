## Python
I decided to challenge myself to use as little libraries as possible, theres some problems where I had to/it was crazy not to use libraries but in general I didnt use many.  
Mostly the libraries used were: 
- copy for some deepcopies
- networkx when there was graph things
- collections and heapq for problems that took hours to run when not using them  

Besides that, I did 2021 and then went back and did all the years before that. Then keeping with it up yearly.
